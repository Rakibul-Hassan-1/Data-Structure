## Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **Description:** A binary tree where each node's left subtree contains values smaller than the node, and the right subtree contains values larger.
- **Features:**
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Search
  - In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals
- **Use Cases:** Searching, sorting, and data storage.

---

## Binary Tree
- **Description:** A general binary tree with no specific order constraints.
- **Features:**
  - Traversals: Pre-order, In-order, Post-order, and Level-order.
  - Depth and height calculations.
- **Use Cases:** Expression trees, hierarchical data representation.

---

## Heap
- **Description:** A tree-based data structure satisfying the heap property:
  - **Max-Heap:** Parent nodes are greater than or equal to children.
  - **Min-Heap:** Parent nodes are smaller than or equal to children.
- **Features:**
  - Insert
  - Extract-Min/Max
  - Heapify
- **Use Cases:** Priority queues, sorting algorithms.

---

## Singly Linked List
- **Description:** A linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next.
- **Features:**
  - Insertion at head, tail, or middle.
  - Deletion.
  - Traversal.
- **Use Cases:** Dynamic data handling.

---

## Queue and STL
- **Description:** A **FIFO** (First In, First Out) data structure.
- **Features:**
  - Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek operations.
  - Implemented using C++ STL.
- **Use Cases:** BFS, task scheduling, buffering.

---

## Stack and STL
- **Description:** A **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) data structure.
- **Features:**
  - Push, Pop, Peek operations.
  - Implemented using C++ STL.
- **Use Cases:** Undo functionality, expression evaluation.

---

## Problem Solving Using Data Structures
- **Examples:**
  - **Binary Trees:**
    - Tree diameter calculation.
    - Level-order traversal for sums.
  - **Linked Lists:**
    - Reversing a list.
    - Detecting and removing cycles.
  - **Heaps:**
    - Efficient scheduling and sorting.

---

## STL-Based Implementations
- **Priority Queue:** Manages elements based on priority.
- **Map:** Key-value pair storage.
- **Set:** Maintains unique elements in sorted order.
